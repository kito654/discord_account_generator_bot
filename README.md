How to use it:
1. Create a bot via discord.com/developers and paste the token inside the settings.py!
2. Invite the discord bot in your server.
3. Create a role for the account generator bot that can only view the channels where you want the bot to be active!
4. Put your accounts in the specified text folder! (For example netflix accounts in netflix.txt)
5. Do $gen (your account type) to generate an account!

Please note:
This bot is a very basic generator and that for a reason. It wouldn't make any sense to code an entire bot if nobody uses it. So if you support this bot,
bump the v3rmillion thread!

(A help and update discord server might come soon)
